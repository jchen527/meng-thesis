Crisis Text Line supports people with mental health issues through texting.
Unfortunately, support is limited by the number of counselors and the time each counselor
has for clients, as well as the cognitive load on counselors from managing multiple
conversations simultaneously. We conducted a contextual inquiry with crisis
counselors to find contributing problems in their workflow. We believe topic modeling
can provide automatic summaries of conversation text to augment note-taking and
transcript-reading. Four simple and familiar visualizations were developed to present
the model data: 1) a list of conversation topics, 2) a donut chart of topic percentages,
3) a line chart of topic trends, and 4) a scatter plot of specific topic points in the text.
Our hypothesis is that these visualizations will help counselors spend more time on
clients without overloading the counselors. The visualizations were evaluated through
a user study to determine their effectiveness against a control interface.
