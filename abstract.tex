Crisis Text Line is a hotline that supports many people with mental health issues
through the medium of texting. Unfortunately, this support is limited by the number
of counselors and the time each counselor spends talking to clients, as well as the
cognitive load placed on counselors from managing multiple conversations at once
for long periods of time. We conducted a contextual inquiry with crisis counselors
to find the contributing problems in their workflow. In order to maximize the time
and brainpower counselors spend helping clients, we believe topic modeling can
provide automatic summaries of conversation text to replace note-taking and reading
through full conversation transcripts. Four simple and familiar visualizations were
developed to present the topic model data. Counselors can choose from varying levels
of granularity: 1) a list of conversation topics, 2) a donut chart of topic percentages,
3) a line chart of topic trends throughout a conversation, and 4) a scatter plot of
specific locations in the text where the topics were detected. Our hypothesis is that
these visualizations will help counselors spend more time on clients, keep track of
different conversations, and improve the quality of client support. Finally, the
visualizations were evaluated through a user study with crisis counselors to determine their
effectiveness against a control interface.
